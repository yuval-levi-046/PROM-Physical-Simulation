# Core Simulation Logic
[ ] Implement smooth (non-constant) acceleration and deceleration curves
[ ] Add different car brains to make it more realistic

# Car Behavior
[ ] Implement lane-switching logic (gap-checking, directional intent)
[ ] Handle car decision-making for switching lanes safely
[ ] Mark or visualize stopped cars
[ ] Have the next_car work for entering a lane (to stop unnecessary collisions)

# Road & Lane Topology
[ ] Build RoadNetworkBuilder for flexible network layouts (junctions, merges, etc.) 
[ ] Add lane.index to identify left/middle/right lanes for smarter lane switching

# Routing & Transfers
[ ] Implement smarter road transitions (not just next_road) #Important
[ ] Add support for car exit reasons (e.g., timeout, congestion, destination) # Important

# Spawning & Flow
[ ] Add spawn rule for traffic-load based insertion (e.g. insert if lane has space)
[ ] Add probabilistic spawner with adjustable density

# Logging & Analytics
[ ] Track car trip durations (exit_time - spawn_time) # Important for the future
[ ] Add reason for car exits in logger
[ ] Add a spawn_log to logger to record where/when cars entered

# Architecture / Helpers
[ ] Create CarRouter or routing system per car
[ ] Enable saving/loading simulation configs (JSON or Python) # Cool idea not necessary

# Experimentation Tools
[ ] Batch runner to test multiple spawn rules or road configs # Important for massive simulations
[ ] Jupyter visualization for congestion heatmaps or trip histograms # Important

# Maintenance
[ ] Add automated unit tests for core.py and controller.py
[ ] Add type hints and docstrings across simulation code
